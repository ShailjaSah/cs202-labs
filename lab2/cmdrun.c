/* cmd_exec(cmd, pass_pipefd)
 *
 *   Execute the single command specified in the 'cmd' command structure.
 *
 *   The 'pass_pipefd' argument is used for pipes.
 *
 *     On input, '*pass_pipefd' is the file descriptor that the
 *     current command should use to read the output of the previous
 *     command. That is, it's the "read end" of the previous
 *     pipe, if there was a previous pipe; if there was not, then
 *     *pass_pipefd will equal STDIN_FILENO.
 *
 *     On output, cmd_exec should set '*pass_pipefd' to the file descriptor
 *     used for reading from THIS command's pipe (so that the next command
 *     can use it). If this command didn't have a pipe -- that is,
 *     if cmd->controlop != PIPE -- then this function should set
 *     '*pass_pipefd = STDIN_FILENO'.
 *
 *   Returns the process ID of the forked child, or < 0 if some system call
 *   fails.
 *
 *   Besides handling normal commands, redirection, and pipes, you must also
 *   handle three internal commands: "cd", "exit", and "our_pwd".
 *   (Why must "cd", "exit", and "our_pwd" (a version of "pwd") be implemented
 *   by the shell, versus simply exec()ing to handle them?)
 *
 *   Note that these special commands still have a status!
 *   For example, "cd DIR" should return status 0 if we successfully change
 *   to the DIR directory, and status 1 otherwise.
 *   Thus, "cd /tmp && echo /tmp exists" should print "/tmp exists" to stdout
 *      if and only if the /tmp directory exists.
 *   Not only this, but redirections should work too!
 *   For example, "cd /tmp > foo" should create an empty file named 'foo';
 *   and "cd /tmp 2> foo" should print any error messages to 'foo'.
 *
 *   Some specifications:
 *
 *       --subshells:
 *         the exit status should be either 0 (if the last
 *         command would have returned 0) or 5 (if the last command
 *         would have returned something non-zero). This is not the
 *         behavior of bash.
 *
 *       --cd:
 *
 *          this builtin takes exactly one argument besides itself (this
 *          is also not bash's behavior). if it is given fewer
 *          ("cd") or more ("cd foo bar"), that is a syntax error.  Any
 *          error (syntax or system call) should result in a non-zero
 *          exit status. Here is the specification for output:
 *
 *                ----If there is a syntax error, your shell should
 *                display the following message verbatim:
 *                   "cd: Syntax error! Wrong number of arguments!"
 *
 *                ----If there is a system call error, your shell should
 *                invoke perror("cd")
 *
 *       --our_pwd:
 *
 *          This stands for "our pwd", which prints the working
 *          directory to stdout, and has exit status 0 if successful and
 *          non-zero otherwise. this builtin takes no arguments besides
 *          itself. Handle errors in analogy with cd. Here, the syntax
 *          error message should be:
 *
 *              "pwd: Syntax error! Wrong number of arguments!"
 *
 *       --exit:
 *
 *          As noted in the lab, exit can take 0 or 1 arguments. If it
 *          is given zero arguments (besides itself), then the shell
 *          exits with command status 0. If it is given one numerical
 *          argument, the shell exits with that numerical argument. If it
 *          is given one non-numerical argument, do something sensible.
 *          If it is given more than one argument, print an error message,
 *          and do not exit.
 *
 *
 *   Implementation hints are given in the function body.

	}

	// Fork the child and execute the command in that child.
	// You will handle all redirections by manipulating file descriptors.
	//
	// This section is fairly long.  It is probably best to implement this
	// part in stages, checking it after each step.  For example:
        //
	//   --First implement just the fork and the execute in the
	//   child (as we saw in class).  This should allow you to
	//   execute simple commands like 'ls'. Some of the tests in
	//   "make grade" ought to pass.
	//   --Next, add support for redirections: as a simple test,
	//   'ls > foo' followed by 'cat < foo' should display the
	//   directory listing. A few more of the tests in "make grade"
	//   should pass.
	//   --Next, support parentheses (a few more tests should pass,
	//     etc.)
	//   --Then pipes (if you use our pseudocode from class as
	//   inspiration, NOTE that the logic is a bit different in this lab)
	//   --And finally the internal commands 'cd', 'exit', and
	//   'our_pwd'.
	//
	//  Throughout, you will be using system calls: fork(), dup2(),
	//  close(), open(), execvp() or execve(), exit(), chdir(), etc.
	//
	//  You can also use perror() to handle error conditions
	//  concisely (type "$ man 3 perror" in a Unix terminal to get
	//  documentation).
	//
	//  You will need to do real C programming here.
	//  Tools like gdb (the debugger) may be useful.
	//
	//  You will also find functions like strcmp() and strtol()
	//  useful. Type "man strcmp", etc. for more information.
	//
	// In the child, you should:
	//    1. Set up stdout to point to this command's pipe, if necessary;
	//       close some file descriptors, if necessary (which ones?)
	//    2. Set up stdin to point to the PREVIOUS command's pipe (that
	//       is, *pass_pipefd), if appropriate; close a file
	//       descriptor (which one?)
	//    3. Set up redirections. Use the open() system call.
	//       Hints:
	//          --For input redirections, the oflag should be O_RDONLY.
	//          --For output redirections (stdout and stderr), what
	//          oflags do you want?
	//          --Set the mode argument of open() to be 0666
	//    4. Execute the command.
	//       There are some special cases:
	//       a. Parentheses.  Execute cmd->subshell. How? Also,
	//          you won't be invoking exec() in this special case,
	//          so think carefully about how this path "ends". (What
	//          would happen if we were to return from the current
	//          function?)
	//       b. A null command (no subshell, no arguments).
	//          Exit with status 0.
	//       c. "exit".
	//       d. "cd".
	//       e. "our_pwd".
	//       f. Remember to make your implementation
	//       consistent with the specification above!
	//
	// In the parent, you should:
	//    1. Close some file descriptors.  Hint: Consider the write end
	//       of this command's pipe, and one other fd as well.
	//    2. Handle the special "exit", "cd", and "our_pwd" commands.
	//    3. Set *pass_pipefd as appropriate.
	//
	// "cd","exit","our_pwd" Hints:
	//    Recall from the comments earlier that you need to return a status,
	//    and do redirections. How can you do these things for a
	//    command executed in the parent shell?
	//    Answer: It's easest if you fork a child ANYWAY!
        //    You should divide functionality between the parent and the child.
        //    Some functions will be executed in each process. For example,
        //         --in the case of "exit", both parent and child
        //         need to exit, but only the parent's exit code "matters",
        //         --in the case of "cd", both parent and child should
        //         try to change directory (use chdir()), but only the child
        //         should print error messages
	//
	//    For the "cd" command, you should change directories AFTER
	//    the fork(), not before it.  Why?
	//    Design some tests with 'bash' that will tell you the answer.
	//    For example, try "cd /tmp ; cd $HOME > foo".  In which directory
	//    does foo appear, /tmp or $HOME?  If you chdir() BEFORE the fork,
	//    in which directory would foo appear, /tmp or $HOME?
	//
	//    EXTRA CREDIT: Our "cd" solution changes the
	//    directory both in the parent process and in the child process.
	//    This introduces a potential race condition.
	//    Explain what that race condition is, and fix it.
	//    Hint: Investigate fchdir().
